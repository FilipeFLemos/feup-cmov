## Assignment 1

This project consists of a shopping and payment system for an electronic supermarket. It was developed using a client-server architecture and composes essentially three main applications: the customer app, the terminal app and the supermarket server.

A  supermarket needs to process shopping and payments in an efficient way for the customer. When a customer enters the supermarket, he can add the products he wants to buy into his application (reading the products QR Code and adding them into the shop basket). Therefore, when he finishes selecting the products, he can move to the checkout by showing the QR Code of his transaction to the supermarket terminal. There, the payment is made using the customer's associated credit card and the supermarket gate is opened.

## Assignment 2

This project consists of a weather application and was developed using the MVVM architecture.

The application needs to fetch the weather data for a specific city and display it in a user friendly way. When a user starts the application, he can add cities to his favorite list or view a quick summary of the that days weather for the cities on that list. By clicking on each city, he will be presented with a more detailed description of the current weather. Moreover, it is also possible to check tomorrowâ€™s forecast, which displays the weather amplitudes, a detailed description and an hourly temperature graph.
