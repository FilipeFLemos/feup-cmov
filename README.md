## Assignment 1

This project consists of a shopping and payment system for an electronic supermarket. It was developed using a client-server architecture and composes essentially three main applications: the customer app, the terminal app and the supermarket server.

A  supermarket needs to process shopping and payments in an efficient way for the customer. When a customer enters the supermarket, he can add the products he wants to buy into his application (reading the products QR Code and adding them into the shop basket). Therefore, when he finishes selecting the products, he can move to the checkout by showing the QR Code of his transaction to the supermarket terminal. There, the payment is made using the customer's associated credit card and the supermarket gate is opened. With this in mind, the system implements all the necessary requirements for its operation presenting them in an intuitive and pleasant way for the final user. 

In the next sections, the application will be described in finer detail, namely its architecture, implementation details and relevant issues. This report concludes with a small reflection about the work done and possible future enhancements.
